- ✅ Unicode emoji crashes fixed (replaced with ASCII)
- ✅ Services run silently (CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag for Windows)
- ✅ All 8/8 services fully functional and healthy
- ✅ Docker healthchecks fixed (endpoint + port corrections)

**Healthcheck Fix** (2025-10-22):
- Fixed docker-compose.backend-services.yml healthchecks for all 8 services
- Corrected port mismatch: services running on 5001-5008, healthchecks checking 5000
- Corrected endpoint: /api/health → /health
- Result: All 8/8 services now reporting HEALTHY status in docker ps

**Testing Results** (2025-10-22):
- All 8 services: ✅ Health endpoints responding correctly
- All 8 services: ✅ Docker healthchecks passing
- Container health: 28/34 (82%) system-wide healthy status
- Stock Screener: ✅ Real market data validated
- Portfolio Optimizer: ✅ Risk parity optimization validated

**Documentation**:

- `SYSTEM_RECOVERY_REPORT_2025-10-22.md`: Complete recovery and healthcheck fix documentation

---

## 📋 PHASE 6.7: SYSTEM STABILIZATION - VERIFIED COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE (8/8 backend services healthy, Traefik 8/8 UP)
**Date Completed**: October 23, 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes

### Objectives Achieved

**Problem Solved**:
All 8 backend analytics services were showing as "unhealthy" despite running, preventing Traefik from discovering them (0/8 → 8/8 registered).

**Root Cause**:
- Port configuration mismatches across services
- Healthchecks checking wrong ports
- Inconsistent SERVICE_PORT usage

### Solution Implemented

**Port Configuration Standardization**:
- Standardized all 8 services to use `SERVICE_PORT` environment variable consistently
- Fixed hardcoded port references in app.py and config.py files
- Updated health endpoint port handling

**Files Modified (8 Backend Services)**:
1. `backend/portfolio_optimizer/app.py` - Added `os.environ.get('SERVICE_PORT', 5000)`
2. `backend/rl_trading/app.py` - Updated health endpoint and port configuration
3. `backend/advanced_backtest/app.py` - Standardized port to SERVICE_PORT
4. `backend/factor_models/app.py` - Standardized port configuration
5. `backend/stock_screener/app.py` - Standardized port to SERVICE_PORT
6. `backend/simulation_engine/config.py` - Changed SIMULATION_PORT → SERVICE_PORT
7. `backend/fractional_diff/config.py` - Changed FRACDIFF_PORT → SERVICE_PORT
8. `backend/meta_labeling/config.py` - Added `os.getenv('SERVICE_PORT', 5000)`

### Build Strategy Optimization

**Sequential vs Parallel Builds**:
- **Previous**: Build all 8 in parallel (5+ minutes, high resource usage)
- **New**: Build sequentially leveraging Docker cache (30 seconds total)
- **Result**: 10x faster builds, all layers cached

**Services Built & Deployed (8/8)**:
| Service | Build Time | Deployment | Health Status |
|---------|------------|------------|---------------|
| portfolio-optimizer | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| rl-trading | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| advanced-backtest | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| factor-models | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| simulation-engine | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
