# Trade2026 Integration - Completion Tracker (UPDATED)

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23 (Production-Ready Architecture Adopted)
**Purpose**: Track ACTUAL completion status of all phases, tasks, and sub-steps

---

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE DECISION (2025-10-23)

**Production-Ready Design Principle**:
> "Build for production even though for the foreseeable future it is only working here locally."

**Key Decisions**:
- ✅ **Traefik as Unified Gateway**: Single external entry point (http://localhost) for all services
- ✅ **Specialized Tools**: Right tool for each job (reverse proxy, static files, API routing)
- ✅ **Container-First**: All services in Docker with proper health checks and restart policies
- ✅ **Network Isolation**: CPGS v1.0 compliant (frontend, lowlatency, backend networks)
- ✅ **Zero Refactoring**: No dev shortcuts that would require rework for production

**Benefits**: Professional architecture, cloud-ready, production-quality from day one

---

- ✅ Docker healthchecks fixed (endpoint + port corrections)

**Healthcheck Fix** (2025-10-22):
- Fixed docker-compose.backend-services.yml healthchecks for all 8 services
- Corrected port mismatch: services running on 5001-5008, healthchecks checking 5000
- Corrected endpoint: /api/health → /health
- Result: All 8/8 services now reporting HEALTHY status in docker ps

**Testing Results** (2025-10-22):

## 📋 PHASE 6.7: SYSTEM STABILIZATION - VERIFIED COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: ✅ 100% COMPLETE (8/8 backend services healthy, Traefik 8/8 UP)
**Date Completed**: October 23, 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes

### Objectives Achieved

**Problem Solved**:
All 8 backend analytics services were showing as "unhealthy" despite running, preventing Traefik from discovering them (0/8 → 8/8 registered).

**Root Cause**:
- Port configuration mismatches across services
- Healthchecks checking wrong ports
- Inconsistent SERVICE_PORT usage

### Solution Implemented

**Port Configuration Standardization**:
- Standardized all 8 services to use `SERVICE_PORT` environment variable consistently
- Fixed hardcoded port references in app.py and config.py files
- Updated health endpoint port handling

**Files Modified (8 Backend Services)**:
1. `backend/portfolio_optimizer/app.py` - Added `os.environ.get('SERVICE_PORT', 5000)`
2. `backend/rl_trading/app.py` - Updated health endpoint and port configuration
3. `backend/advanced_backtest/app.py` - Standardized port to SERVICE_PORT
4. `backend/factor_models/app.py` - Standardized port configuration
5. `backend/stock_screener/app.py` - Standardized port to SERVICE_PORT
6. `backend/simulation_engine/config.py` - Changed SIMULATION_PORT → SERVICE_PORT
7. `backend/fractional_diff/config.py` - Changed FRACDIFF_PORT → SERVICE_PORT
8. `backend/meta_labeling/config.py` - Added `os.getenv('SERVICE_PORT', 5000)`

### Build Strategy Optimization

**Sequential vs Parallel Builds**:
- **Previous**: Build all 8 in parallel (5+ minutes, high resource usage)
- **New**: Build sequentially leveraging Docker cache (30 seconds total)
- **Result**: 10x faster builds, all layers cached

**Services Built & Deployed (8/8)**:
| Service | Build Time | Deployment | Health Status |
|---------|------------|------------|---------------|
| portfolio-optimizer | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| rl-trading | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| advanced-backtest | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |
| factor-models | Cached | ✅ Started | ✅ Healthy |

### Critical Issues Status

**Issue 1: Docker QuestDB Connectivity** (✅ RESOLVED - 2025-10-23):
- **Problem**: Services used `localhost:9000` but inside Docker `localhost` = container itself
- **Solution**: Updated `data_fetcher.py` to use `os.getenv("QUESTDB_URL", "http://questdb:9000")`
- **Result**: All 8 services now successfully connect to QuestDB
- **Git Commit**: `1d3051a` - fix: QuestDB Docker Networking - CRITICAL Blocker Resolved
- **Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Issue 2: yfinance Fallback Failure** (HIGH - Priority 2):
- **Problem**: yfinance.download() returns empty DataFrame (0 assets)
- **Possible Causes**: Network restrictions, API rate limits, invalid tickers
- **Impact**: External data fallback not working
- **Time to Fix**: 1 hour

**Issue 3: Limited Historical Data** (MEDIUM - Priority 3):
- **Problem**: QuestDB only has 1 hour of data (Oct 21, 2025)
- **Impact**: Cannot calculate returns (need ≥ 2 observations)
- **Solution**: Backfill 30-90 days of historical data
- **Time to Fix**: 2-3 hours

### Log Evidence (After QuestDB Fix)

**Before Fix**:
```
WARNING: QuestDB query failed: Connection refused to localhost:9000
```

**After Fix**:
```
WARNING: No IBKR data found for XLV in QuestDB  ← Successful connection!
INFO: ✗ XLV: IBKR data unavailable, falling back to yfinance
INFO: Fetching 1 symbols from yfinance: ['XLV']
INFO: Running HRP on 0 assets using single linkage  ← Still blocked by yfinance/data issues
```

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Services Deployed | 8/8 | 8/8 | ✅ PASS |
| Services Healthy | 8/8 | 8/8 | ✅ PASS |

## 📞 CORRECTED QUICK REFERENCE

### Check Real Status
```bash
# See actual running services
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Count services
docker ps -q | wc -l

# Check resource usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Test order flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8099/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"BTCUSDT","side":"buy","quantity":0.001,"price":45000,"order_type":"LIMIT"}'

# Check data persistence
curl "http://localhost:9000/exec?query=SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20orders"
```

### Service Endpoints
- OMS: http://localhost:8099/health
- Risk: http://localhost:8103/health
- Gateway: http://localhost:8080/health
- QuestDB: http://localhost:9000
- ClickHouse: http://localhost:8123
