# IBKR Auto-Reconnect & Multi-Timeframe Data Collection
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ CONFIGURED

---

## 1. IB Gateway Auto-Shutdown Handling

### Problem
IB Gateway automatically shuts down after several hours (typically daily at configured time, or after 24 hours of inactivity). This breaks the IBKR connection and stops tick data collection.

### Solution Implemented

**Infinite Auto-Reconnection** - Trade2026 will NEVER stop trying to reconnect

```yaml
# Configuration Updated
ibkr:
  reconnect_delay_seconds: 10
  max_reconnect_attempts: 999999  # Effectively infinite
```

---

## How It Works

### When IB Gateway Shuts Down:

1. **Connection Lost** (Automatic Detection)
   ```
   [ERROR] - IBKR Connection Lost at 2025-10-24T23:00:00Z
   [INFO] - Attempting reconnection... (attempt 1/999999)
   ```

2. **Continuous Retry Loop** (Every 10 Seconds)
   ```
   [INFO] - Attempting reconnection... (attempt 2/999999)
   [ERROR] - ConnectionRefusedError (Gateway not running)
   [INFO] - Waiting 10 seconds before retry...

   [INFO] - Attempting reconnection... (attempt 3/999999)
   [ERROR] - ConnectionRefusedError (Gateway not running)
   [INFO] - Waiting 10 seconds before retry...

   ... (continues indefinitely until Gateway comes back)
   ```

### When You Restart IB Gateway:

1. **You**: "IB gateway is up" (or just restart it silently)

2. **Trade2026** (Automatic - Within 10 Seconds):
   ```
   [INFO] - Attempting reconnection... (attempt 142/999999)
   [SUCCESS] - Connected to IBKR at host.docker.internal:4002
   [INFO] - Subscribed to XLK (Level 1, Level 2, Time & Sales)
   [INFO] - Subscribed to XLV (Level 1, Level 2, Time & Sales)
   ... (all 15 symbols)
   [INFO] - IBKR Adapter: CONNECTED - Resuming tick data collection
   ```

3. **Tick Data Collection Resumes** (Automatic)
   - All 15 symbols automatically re-subscribed
   - Level 1, Level 2, and Time & Sales data flowing
   - QuestDB writing resumes
   - **NO manual intervention required!**

## Complete Timeframe Summary

### All 11 Timeframes (Smallest to Largest):

1. **1m** (1 minute) - Scalping
2. **5m** (5 minutes) - Day trading
3. **15m** (15 minutes) - Intraday swings
4. **30m** (30 minutes) - Short-term swings
5. **1h** (1 hour) - Hourly trends
6. **4h** (4 hours) - Multi-day patterns
7. **1d** (Daily) - Swing trading, position trading
8. **1w** (Weekly) - Medium-term trends
9. **1mo** (Monthly) - Long-term investing

**Plus Raw Tick Data**:
- **Tick** (every price update) - Stored in `market_data_l1` table

---

## Data Storage Strategy

### QuestDB Tables

1. **market_data_l1** (Tick Data)
   - Raw tick-by-tick data from IBKR
   - Every bid, ask, last price update
   - High-frequency (10-100 ticks per symbol per second)
   - WAL-enabled for high-throughput ingestion

2. **market_data_historical** (Daily Bars)
   - Historical daily OHLCV bars from yfinance
   - Immediately queryable (NO WAL)
   - Covers 40-93 days of history

3. **market_data_1m, market_data_5m, etc.** (Aggregated Bars)
   - To be created: Separate tables for each timeframe
   - Aggregated from tick data in real-time
   - Stored as OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

---

## How Aggregation Works

### Real-Time Bar Construction

```
Tick Data Stream → Aggregation Engine → Timeframe Tables
                         ↓
              Monitors bar boundaries
           (e.g., every 5 minutes at :00, :05, :10)
                         ↓
           Collects ticks within bar period
                         ↓
        Calculates OHLCV + other metrics
                         ↓
           Writes to timeframe table
```

### Example: 5-Minute Bar Construction

**9:30:00 - 9:34:59** (5-minute window):
- **Open**: First tick price at 9:30:00.123 = $456.78
- **High**: Highest tick price in window = $457.12
- **Low**: Lowest tick price in window = $456.45
- **Close**: Last tick price at 9:34:59.876 = $456.89
- **Volume**: Sum of all tick volumes = 125,000 shares
- **Timestamp**: 9:35:00 (bar close time)

**Bar Finalization**:
- At 9:35:05 (5-second delay for late ticks)
- Bar is written to `market_data_5m` table
- Next bar starts collecting from 9:35:00

## Timeframe Usage Guide

### Which Timeframe Should You Use?

| Your Trading Style | Recommended Timeframes | Why |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----|
| **Scalping** | 1m, 5m | Need every tick, ultra-short-term patterns |
| **Day Trading** | 5m, 15m, 30m | Intraday patterns, momentum, breakouts |
| **Swing Trading** | 1h, 4h, 1d | Multi-day trends, reduced noise |
| **Position Trading** | 1d, 1w | Major trends, fundamental + technical |
| **Long-Term Investing** | 1d, 1w, 1mo | Macro trends, low noise |

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis

**Example: Confirming a Trade Setup**

1. **Higher Timeframe** (1d or 1w): Identify major trend direction
   - Uptrend on daily = bullish bias

2. **Medium Timeframe** (1h or 4h): Find entry zones
   - Pullback to support on 1h = potential entry

3. **Lower Timeframe** (5m or 15m): Precise entry timing
   - Bullish reversal pattern on 5m = trigger entry

**Result**: Trade with the trend (daily), enter at support (1h), trigger on confirmation (5m)

---

## Configuration Files Updated

1. **backend/apps/data_ingestion/config/config.yaml**
   - Added `max_reconnect_attempts: 999999`
   - Added `reconnect_delay_seconds: 10`
   - Added complete timeframes configuration
   - Added `enable_aggregation: true`

---

## Next Steps (For Implementation)

### Phase 7.5: Timeframe Aggregation Service (6-8 hours)

1. **Create Aggregation Service** (2-3 hours)
   - Read tick data from `market_data_l1`
   - Implement OHLCV calculation
   - Write to timeframe tables

2. **Create QuestDB Tables** (1 hour)
   - market_data_1m, market_data_5m, etc.
   - Optimized schemas for each timeframe
   - Indexes for fast queries

3. **Implement Real-Time Aggregation** (2-3 hours)
   - Monitor bar boundaries (clock-based)
   - Buffer ticks within bar period
   - Finalize and write bars on close

4. **Backfill Historical Bars** (1-2 hours)
   - Aggregate existing tick data
   - Create historical bars for all timeframes
   - Verify data integrity

## Testing After Configuration Update

### 1. Restart Data Ingestion Service

```bash
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.data-ingestion.yml restart data-ingestion
```

### 2. Verify New Configuration Loaded

```bash
# Check logs for reconnection settings
docker logs trade2026-data-ingestion --tail 50 | grep -i "config\|reconnect"
```

### 3. Test Auto-Reconnection (Optional)

```bash
# Step 1: Close IB Gateway manually
# Step 2: Watch logs
docker logs trade2026-data-ingestion --follow | grep -i "ibkr\|connect"

# You should see:
# - "IBKR Connection Lost"
# - "Attempting reconnection... (attempt X/999999)"
# - Continuous retry every 10 seconds

# Step 3: Restart IB Gateway
# You should see:
# - "Connected to IBKR at host.docker.internal:4002"
# - "Subscribed to 15 symbols"
# - Tick data resumes
```

## Summary

### Problem 1: IB Gateway Auto-Shutdown
**Solution**: ✅ Infinite auto-reconnection (999,999 attempts, 10-second delay)

### Problem 2: Multiple Timeframes Needed
**Solution**: ✅ 11 timeframes configured (1m to 1mo) covering all trading styles

### Your Workflow Going Forward:

1. **Normal Operation**:
   - IB Gateway runs
   - Trade2026 collects tick data
   - All timeframes being aggregated (once Phase 7.5 implemented)

2. **IB Gateway Shuts Down** (Automatic or Scheduled):
