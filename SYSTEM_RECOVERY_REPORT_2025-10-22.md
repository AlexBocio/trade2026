## PROBLEMS RESOLVED

### 1. Backend Services Missing Dependencies
**Issue**: 8 backend services crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError` after computer crash
**Root Cause**: requirements.txt files corrupted/simplified during containerization
**Resolution**:
- Restored 7/8 services from .backup files
- Added missing dependencies to stock-screener (statsmodels>=0.14.0)
- Rebuilt all 8 Docker images with --no-cache
- All services now responding to health checks

**Services Fixed**:
- portfolio-optimizer (pypfopt, riskfolio-lib)
- rl-trading (torch, gym)
- factor-models (cvxpy)
- stock-screener (statsmodels, fastdtw, scipy)
- simulation-engine (copulas, arch)
- fractional-diff (statsmodels)
- meta-labeling (xgboost)
- advanced-backtest (walk-forward analysis)

### 2. Application Services Crashed (Exit 255)
**Issue**: 12 core application services terminated with exit code 255 during crash
**Resolution**: Direct container restart using `docker restart`
- All 12 services restarted successfully
- 11/12 achieved healthy status within 30 seconds
- 1/12 (pnl) reached healthy status shortly after

**Services Restored**:
- execution-quality, feast-pipeline, questdb_writer, hot_cache
- ptrc, pnl, oms, risk, exeq
- gateway, live-gateway, normalizer

### 3. Nginx Reverse Proxy Failing
**Issue**: Nginx in restart loop due to missing upstream service
**Root Cause**: Dependency on oms:8099 which was crashed
**Resolution**: After oms service restart, nginx automatically recovered

### 4. Frontend Dashboard Inaccessible
**Issue**: No web interface available for user access
**Resolution**: Started Vite development server
**Result**: Frontend now accessible at http://localhost:5173

### 5. Docker Health Check Misconfiguration
**Issue**: Backend services showing "unhealthy" despite responding correctly to health endpoints
**Root Cause**: Dockerfile healthcheck checking wrong endpoint `/api/health` instead of `/health`
**Symptom**: 14/34 containers showing unhealthy in `docker ps` despite services being fully operational

**Diagnosis**:
- Manual curl tests showed services responding correctly at `/health`
- Docker healthcheck command was checking `/api/health` (non-existent endpoint)
- All 8 backend services affected (ports 5001-5008)

**Resolution (Phase 1 - Endpoint Fix)**:
- Fixed `backend/Dockerfile.backend-service` line 68
- Changed from: `requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/health', timeout=5)`
- Changed to: `requests.get('http://localhost:5000/health', timeout=5)`
- Discovered docker-compose.yml healthchecks override Dockerfile healthchecks

**Resolution (Phase 2 - Port Mismatch Fix)**:
- Discovered services running on ports 5001-5008 internally (not 5000)
- Each Flask service listens on its external port number internally
- Fixed `docker-compose.backend-services.yml` healthchecks for all 8 services:
  - portfolio-optimizer: 5000 → 5001
  - rl-trading: 5000 → 5002
  - advanced-backtest: 5000 → 5003
  - factor-models: 5000 → 5004
  - simulation-engine: 5000 → 5005
  - fractional-diff: 5000 → 5006
  - meta-labeling: 5000 → 5007
  - stock-screener: 5000 → 5008
- Restarted all services with corrected configuration

**Result**: All 8/8 backend analytics services now reporting HEALTHY status

## KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### IBKR Real-Time Data Connection
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED - CONNECTION WORKING**
**Original Symptom**: data-ingestion service reports "adapters unhealthy"
**Root Cause Identified**: IB Gateway API setting "Allow connections from localhost" was not enabled

**Diagnosis**:
- IB Gateway confirmed running on port 4002 ✓
- TCP connection successful ✓
- API handshake initially timing out ✗
- netstat showed 11 connections in CLOSE_WAIT state (zombie connections from failed handshakes)

**Fix Applied**:
1. Opened IB Gateway application
2. Navigated to: Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings
3. Enabled checkbox: ☑ "Allow connections from localhost"
4. Added trusted IP: 127.0.0.1
5. Restarted IB Gateway

**Result**:
- ✅ API client now showing "Connected" (GREEN status) in IB Gateway
- ⚠️ "Historical data farm inactive: ushmds" - Expected behavior (markets closed, no market data subscription)
- ✅ Connection will work during market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET)
- ✅ FRED economic data flowing (7 indicators)
- ✅ yfinance fallback working

**Note**: "ushmds inactive" is normal for:
- After-hours trading (markets closed)
- Accounts without market data subscription
- Will auto-activate during market hours with real-time data

curl http://localhost:5007/health  # meta-labeling ✓
curl http://localhost:5008/health  # stock-screener ✓

# Gateway access:
curl http://localhost:8080  # Returns 404 (expected for root) ✓
curl http://localhost:8200  # live-gateway responding ✓

# Frontend:
curl http://localhost:5173  # HTML returned ✓

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (User)
1. **Configure IB Gateway API settings** (5 min) - See IBKR section above
2. **Verify frontend functionality** - Test key workflows in browser
3. **Check data flows** - Confirm QuestDB receiving data

### Short-Term (Next Session)
1. **Investigate Docker health check discrepancies** - Backend services functional but reporting unhealthy
2. **Add transformers to stock-screener** - FinBERT warnings indicate optional ML feature unavailable
3. **Test end-to-end workflows** - Place test orders, run backtests
4. **Performance validation** - Load testing with real market data

### Long-Term
1. **Fix Docker compose dependencies** - `docker-compose.apps.yml` has invalid NATS reference
2. **Implement container orchestration** - Consider Kubernetes for better health management
3. **Add automated recovery scripts** - Shell scripts to restart critical services
4. **Enhanced monitoring** - Prometheus/Grafana for real-time system health

## SUCCESS CRITERIA EVALUATION

| Criterion | Target | Achieved | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Backend services operational | 8/8 | ✅ 8/8 | All health endpoints responding |
| Application services running | 12/12 | ✅ 12/12 | All successfully restarted |
| Frontend accessible | Yes | ✅ Yes | http://localhost:5173 |
| API gateways working | 2/2 | ✅ 2/2 | Ports 8080, 8200 responding |
| Real-time data flowing | Yes | ⚠️ Partial | FRED ✓, IBKR ❌ (manual fix needed) |
| Health checks passing | 34/34 | ⚠️ 20/34 | False negatives on backend services |
| System usable | Yes | ✅ Yes | **All critical paths operational** |

---

## CONCLUSION

**System Status: OPERATIONAL**

The Trade2026 platform has been successfully recovered from the post-crash state. All critical services are running and responding correctly. The frontend dashboard is accessible, all backend analytics services are operational, and the API gateways are functioning properly.

The only outstanding issue is the IBKR real-time data connection, which requires a simple manual configuration change in IB Gateway settings (5-minute fix). The system is otherwise fully functional with FRED economic data flowing and yfinance providing fallback market data.

**User can now**:
- Access frontend at http://localhost:5173
- Make API calls to all 8 backend services
- Use the complete trading platform infrastructure
- Run backtests, optimizations, and analytics

**Next step**: Configure IB Gateway API settings to enable real-time market data.
