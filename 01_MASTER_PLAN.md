## üìã PHASE OVERVIEW

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - P0
**Goal**: Create unified directory structure and core infrastructure

**Tasks**: 5 instructions (detailed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-foundation))
- Create Trade2026 directory structure
- Setup Docker networks (CPGS v1.0)
- Migrate core infrastructure (NATS, Valkey, databases)
- Configure unified docker-compose
- Test core services health

**Exit Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Directory structure exists
- ‚úÖ 8/8 core services healthy
- ‚úÖ Networks configured (frontend, lowlatency, backend)

#### Phase 1 Quality Assurance

**Validation Gates**:
Starting with Task 03, every task includes a validation gate that:
- Verifies all previous tasks completed successfully
- Tests integration between previous tasks
- Requires passing all validations before proceeding
- Includes mandatory STOP checkpoint

**Testing Flow Per Task**:
```
Component ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate
                                                          ‚Üì
                                                   Validation Gate
                                                          ‚Üì
                                                    Next Task
```

**Task-by-Task Breakdown**:

**Task 01**: Create directories
- Component: Directories created
- Test: All directories exist
- No validation gate (first task)

**Task 02**: Create networks
- Component: Networks created
- Test: Connectivity & isolation
- No validation gate yet (added in Task 03)

**Task 03**: Migrate services
- **Validation Gate**: Verify Tasks 01-02 + integration
- Component: 8 services migrated
- Test: Each service individually
- Integrate: Services use networks + directories
- Test: All services working together
- Deploy: All services operational
- Validate: Comprehensive service tests

**Task 04**: Docker Compose
- **Validation Gate**: Verify Tasks 01-03 + integration
- Component: Compose files + scripts
- Test: Each script works
- Integrate: Compose orchestrates all previous tasks
- Test: Bring up/down all services
- Deploy: Single-command deployment
- Validate: Complete platform operational

**Task 05**: Final Validation
- **Validation Gate**: Verify Tasks 01-04 + integration
- Comprehensive testing of everything
- Integration testing across all components
- Performance testing
- Documentation of all results
- **Phase 1 COMPLETE**

**Comprehensive Implementation**:
All implementations in Phase 1 must be:
- **Complete**: No shortcuts or "minimal" configurations
- **Tested**: Component, integration, performance, persistence tests
- **Documented**: Every choice explained, every result recorded
- **Official**: All components from official sources only

**Official Sources**:
All Docker images from Docker Hub official:
- NATS: `nats:2.10-alpine`
- Valkey: `valkey/valkey:8-alpine`
- QuestDB: `questdb/questdb:latest`
- ClickHouse: `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.9`
- SeaweedFS: `chrislusf/seaweedfs:latest`
- OpenSearch: `opensearchproject/opensearch:2`

authn and OPA built from source (official project code).

**Testing Requirements**:
Every service must pass:
1. Component test: Service works individually
2. Integration test: Service works with dependencies
3. Performance test: Latency and throughput acceptable
4. Persistence test: Data survives restart
5. Network test: Can communicate with other services

No service proceeds to next task until all tests pass.

### Phase 6.5: Backend Services Migration (Trade2025) - P1
**Goal**: Migrate 8 advanced backend services from Trade2025 to Trade2026

**Overview**:
This phase bridges the gap between PRISM Physics (Phase 5) and testing (Phase 7) by migrating the remaining high-value analytics services from the Trade2025 backend.

**Services Migrated** (Ports 5001-5008):
1. **Portfolio Optimizer** (5001): Mean-variance, HRP, HERC, risk parity algorithms
2. **RL Trading** (5002): DQN and PPO reinforcement learning agents
3. **Advanced Backtest** (5003): Walk-forward optimization, PBO analysis, robustness testing
4. **Factor Models** (5004): Barra model, PCA factor extraction, risk attribution
5. **Simulation Engine** (5005): Monte Carlo simulation for strategy validation
6. **Fractional Differentiation** (5006): Stationarity transformation for ML features
7. **Meta-Labeling** (5007): ML model filtering to improve strategy signals
8. **Stock Screener** (5008): 100+ endpoints for comprehensive market analysis

**Exit Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All 8 services copied to Trade2026/backend/
- ‚úÖ Python 3.13 compatibility fixes applied
- ‚úÖ Services run silently (no console windows)
- ‚úÖ All services pass health checks
- ‚úÖ 6/8 services fully functional with real data

**Known Issues** (2 services):
- Factor Models: yfinance data access issue (retry logic needed)
- Portfolio Optimizer: Endpoint path mismatch (documentation update needed)

**Documentation**:
- `BACKEND_SERVICES_STATUS.md`: Service inventory and features
- `BACKEND_TESTING_RESULTS.md`: Comprehensive testing report

### Phases 7-8: Optional/Deferred
See appendices for details. These can be skipped or done later.

---

## üöÄ EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Recommended Approach

**Week 1**: Foundation
```bash
# Generate 5 instructions for Phase 1
# Execute sequentially with Claude Code
# Validate all core services healthy
```

**Week 2-3**: Backend Migration
```bash
# Generate 10 instructions for Phase 2
# Migrate services one-by-one
# Test each service individually
```

**Week 3-4**: Frontend Integration
```bash
# Generate 8 instructions for Phase 3
# Update API clients progressively
# Test each API integration
```

**Decision Point**: After Phase 3
- ‚úÖ If working well ‚Üí Continue to Phase 4 (ML Library)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è If issues ‚Üí Fix before proceeding
- ‚úÖ If MVP sufficient ‚Üí Stop here, polish, deploy

---

## üéØ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Docker DNS Names (Never localhost)
‚ùå Bad: `nats_url: localhost:4222`
‚úÖ Good: `nats_url: nats:4222`

### 2. Unified Data Directory
All data in: `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\data\`

### 3. CPGS v1.0 Compliance
- Frontend: 80, 443
- Low-latency: 8000-8199
- Backend: 8300-8499

### 4. Sequential Execution
Complete one phase before starting next

### 5. Test Each Component
Before integrating with others

---

## üìä INSTRUCTION GENERATION PLAN

### Total Instructions Needed: 45

**Group A - MVP (23 instructions)**: 
- Phase 1: 5 instructions
- Phase 2: 10 instructions
- Phase 3: 8 instructions

**Group B - ML Library (14 instructions)**:
- Phase 4: 14 instructions

**Group C - Optional (8 instructions)**:
- Phase 5-8: 8 instructions

### Generation Strategy

**Option 1: Phased Generation (Recommended)**
- Generate 5 instructions (Phase 1)
- Execute and validate
- Generate next batch when ready

**Option 2: MVP Batch**
- Generate all 23 MVP instructions
- Execute Phases 1-3
- Decide on Phase 4 later

**Option 3: Full Batch**
- Generate all 45 instructions
- Execute sequentially
