## üéØ What is PRISM?

**PRISM** (Probability-based Risk Integration & Simulation Model) is a physics-based market simulation engine that provides:

- Realistic order book dynamics
- Liquidity modeling and market impact
- Physics-based price discovery
- Multi-agent market simulation
- Realistic execution with slippage
- Market microstructure analytics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DECISION: Should You Build PRISM?

### Build PRISM IF:
- ‚úÖ You need realistic market simulation
- ‚úÖ You want high-fidelity backtesting
- ‚úÖ You need market impact analysis
- ‚úÖ You have 40-50 hours available
- ‚úÖ Phase 4 is 100% complete

### Skip PRISM IF:
- ‚ùå Basic backtesting is sufficient
- ‚ùå Time-constrained project
- ‚ùå Simple execution is preferred
- ‚ùå Phase 4 not complete

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
cd C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\instructions\phase5

# 1. Run validation gate (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
bash PHASE5_PROMPT00_VALIDATION_GATE.md

# 2. If validation passes, proceed with implementation
cat PHASE5_PRISM_CONSOLIDATED.md

# 3. Follow 8 components sequentially:
#    - Core Engine (6-8 hours)
#    - Order Book Simulator (6-8 hours)
#    - Liquidity & Market Impact (5-6 hours)
#    - Price Discovery (4-5 hours)
#    - Execution Engine (5-6 hours)
#    - Multi-Agent Simulation (6-8 hours)
#    - Analytics & Metrics (4-5 hours)
#    - Integration & Testing (6-8 hours)
```

## üìä Implementation Roadmap

**8 Major Components**:
1. PRISM Core Engine - FastAPI service, configuration
2. Order Book Simulator - Realistic LOB with matching
3. Liquidity Model - Market impact calculation
4. Price Discovery - Physics-based price formation
5. Execution Engine - Order processing with slippage
6. Multi-Agent System - Market makers, noise/informed traders
7. Analytics - Microstructure metrics
8. Integration - Connect with Library Service

**Total**: 40-50 hours

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Phase 5 complete when:
- [ ] PRISM service running on port 8360
- [ ] Order book simulation realistic
- [ ] Liquidity/impact models working
- [ ] Price discovery physics-based
- [ ] Execution handles orders realistically
- [ ] Multi-agent simulation running
- [ ] Analytics calculating metrics
- [ ] Integrated with Library Service
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] System stable 10+ minutes

---

## üîó Integration Points

PRISM integrates with:
- **Library Service** (Phase 4) - Load strategies
- **QuestDB** (Phase 3) - Store execution data
- **Backend Services** (Phase 3) - Data infrastructure

---

## üìù Notes

- **Optional**: PRISM is not required for core platform
- **Advanced**: Requires understanding of market microstructure
- **Resource-intensive**: Simulation requires significant compute
- **Realistic**: Provides most accurate backtesting

**Next Action**: Run PHASE5_PROMPT00_VALIDATION_GATE.md

**Status**: Ready for validation ‚úÖ
