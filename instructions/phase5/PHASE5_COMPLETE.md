## 🎯 PHASE 5 OVERVIEW

### What is PRISM?

**PRISM** = Probability-based Risk Integration & Simulation Model

A physics-based market simulation engine that provides:
- Realistic order book dynamics
- Liquidity modeling and market impact
- Physics-based price discovery
- Multi-agent market simulation
- Realistic execution with slippage
- Market microstructure analytics

### Time Required: 40-50 hours (2-3 weeks)

---

## 🚀 HOW TO EXECUTE

### Step 1: Validation Gate (REQUIRED)
```bash
cd C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\instructions\phase5

# Run validation
bash PHASE5_PROMPT00_VALIDATION_GATE.md

# Must pass all checks before proceeding
```

### Step 2: Implement PRISM (If validation passes)
```bash
# Follow consolidated guide
cat PHASE5_PRISM_CONSOLIDATED.md

# 8 Components (execute sequentially):
# 1. Core Engine (6-8 hours)
# 2. Order Book Simulator (6-8 hours)
# 3. Liquidity & Market Impact (5-6 hours)
# 4. Price Discovery (4-5 hours)
# 5. Execution Engine (5-6 hours)
# 6. Multi-Agent Simulation (6-8 hours)
# 7. Analytics & Metrics (4-5 hours)
# 8. Integration & Testing (6-8 hours)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DECISION

### Build PRISM IF:
- ✅ Phase 4 is 100% complete
- ✅ You need realistic market simulation
- ✅ You want high-fidelity backtesting
- ✅ You need market impact analysis
- ✅ You have 40-50 hours available

### Skip PRISM IF:
- ❌ Phase 4 not complete
- ❌ Basic backtesting is sufficient
- ❌ Time-constrained project
- ❌ Simple execution preferred

## 📝 NOTES

### Important Reminders:
- **Optional Component**: PRISM is not required for core platform
- **Phase 4 Required**: Must complete Phase 4 first
- **Advanced Feature**: Requires market microstructure knowledge
- **Compute Intensive**: Simulation requires significant resources
- **Realistic Results**: Most accurate backtesting available

### Use Cases:
1. High-fidelity strategy backtesting
2. Market impact analysis
3. Liquidity research
4. Execution algorithm development
5. Risk analysis with realistic scenarios
