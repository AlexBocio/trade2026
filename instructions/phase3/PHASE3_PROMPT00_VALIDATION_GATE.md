# Phase 3 - Prompt 00: Validation Gate

**Phase**: 3 - Frontend Integration  
**Prompt**: 00 (Validation Gate)  
**Purpose**: Validate Phase 2 complete before starting Phase 3  
**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Run before any Phase 3 work

---

## üõë MANDATORY PREREQUISITES

### Phase 2 Must Be Complete

Before starting Phase 3, you **MUST** verify Phase 2 is complete and operational.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 2 VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### 1. All Backend Services Running

```bash
cd C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\infrastructure\docker

# Check all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.apps.yml ps

# Expected: All services showing "healthy" status
```

**Required Services** (minimum for MVP):

**Core Infrastructure** (8 services):
- [ ] nats - running (healthy)
- [ ] valkey - running (healthy)
- [ ] questdb - running (healthy)
- [ ] clickhouse - running (healthy)
- [ ] seaweedfs - running (healthy)
- [ ] opensearch - running (healthy)
- [ ] authn - running (healthy)
- [ ] opa - running (healthy)

**Application Services** (minimum 7 services):
- [ ] normalizer - running (healthy)
- [ ] sink-ticks - running (healthy)
- [ ] sink-alt - running (healthy)
- [ ] gateway - running (healthy)
- [ ] live-gateway - running (healthy)
- [ ] risk - running (healthy)
- [ ] oms - running (healthy)

**Additional Services** (optional but recommended):
- [ ] ptrc - running (healthy)
- [ ] feast-pipeline - running (healthy)
- [ ] execution-quality - running (healthy)

---

### 2. Backend API Endpoints Accessible

Test that all backend services are responding:

```bash
# Test OMS API
curl -f http://localhost:8099/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}

# Test Risk API
curl -f http://localhost:8103/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}

# Test Gateway API
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}

# Test Live Gateway API
curl -f http://localhost:8200/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}
```

**All health checks must return 200 OK**

- [ ] OMS health check passes (port 8099)
- [ ] Risk health check passes (port 8103)
- [ ] Gateway health check passes (port 8080)
- [ ] Live Gateway health check passes (port 8200)
- [ ] PTRC health check passes (port 8109) - optional

---

### 3. Data Pipeline Operational

Verify end-to-end data flow:

```bash
# Check NATS has data flowing
docker exec -it nats nats stream ls
# Expected: See streams

# Check QuestDB has data
curl "http://localhost:9000/exec?query=SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20ohlcv_1m"
# Expected: Should have records

# Check ClickHouse has data
curl "http://localhost:8123/?query=SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20trade2026.fills"
# Expected: Should have records (if any trades executed)
```

**Data Flow Checks**:
- [ ] NATS streams exist and active
- [ ] QuestDB has OHLCV data
- [ ] Market data flowing
- [ ] No errors in logs

---

### 4. Trading Flow Functional

Test core trading functionality:

```bash
# Submit test order via OMS
curl -X POST http://localhost:8099/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account": "test_account",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "side": "buy",
    "type": "limit",
    "quantity": 0.001,
    "price": 45000.0
  }'

# Expected: {"status": "submitted", "order_id": "..."}
```

**Trading Flow Checks**:
- [ ] Order submission works
- [ ] Risk checks executing (< 1.5ms)
- [ ] Orders routing to live-gateway
- [ ] Paper trading functional
- [ ] Position tracking working

---

### 5. Performance Benchmarks Met

Verify Phase 2 performance requirements:

```bash
# Check risk service latency
docker logs risk | grep "latency" | tail -20
# Expected: P50 < 1.5ms

# Check OMS latency
docker logs oms | grep "latency" | tail -20
# Expected: P50 < 10ms

# Check no errors
docker logs risk | grep "ERROR" | tail -20
docker logs oms | grep "ERROR" | tail -20
# Expected: No recent errors
```

**Performance Checks**:
- [ ] Risk service P50 ‚â§ 1.5ms
- [ ] OMS P50 ‚â§ 10ms
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Services stable (no restarts)

---

### 6. Docker Networks Configured

Verify CPGS v1.0 network configuration:

```bash
# Check networks exist
docker network ls | grep trade2026

# Expected:
# trade2026_frontend
# trade2026_lowlatency
# trade2026_backend
```

**Network Checks**:
- [ ] trade2026_frontend network exists
- [ ] trade2026_lowlatency network exists
- [ ] trade2026_backend network exists

---

### 7. Configuration Files Ready

Verify all backend configuration files exist:

```bash
cd C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026

# Check configs exist
ls -la config/backend/oms/config.yaml
ls -la config/backend/risk/config.yaml
ls -la config/backend/gateway/config.yaml
ls -la config/backend/live_gateway/config.yaml
```

**Config Checks**:
- [ ] All backend config files exist
- [ ] All configs use Docker service names (not localhost)
- [ ] Secrets properly configured
