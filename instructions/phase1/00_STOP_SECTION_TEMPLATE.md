# üõë STOP - READ THIS FIRST üõë

## MANDATORY READING BEFORE ANY CODE EXECUTION

**Claude Code**: You MUST read these files IN FULL before starting any work. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### 1. MASTER_GUIDELINES.md (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)
**Location**: `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\ClaudeKnowledge\MASTER_GUIDELINES.md`

**YOU MUST READ THESE SECTIONS** (use file_read tool):
- [ ] **New Session Startup Protocol** - How to begin ANY session
- [ ] **Core Development Rules** - Component Isolation, Read Before Write, Backup Critical Files
- [ ] **6-Phase Mandatory Workflow** - EVERY task follows this workflow
- [ ] **File Operations** - Read before write, validation, error handling
- [ ] **Testing & Validation Rules** - How to validate your work
- [ ] **Documentation Standards** - What to document

**Why This Matters**: These guidelines contain critical rules about:
- ‚úÖ How to read files before modifying them
- ‚úÖ How to handle errors and rollback
- ‚úÖ Token budget management (you have limits!)
- ‚úÖ Testing and validation requirements
- ‚úÖ When to stop and ask for help

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes to read the relevant sections

### 2. Project Context (MUST READ AFTER GUIDELINES)
**Location**: `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\MASTER_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Read the full overview to understand the integration project

**Location**: `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\appendices\appendix_A_foundation.md`
- [ ] Read Phase 1 details to understand what you're building

**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONSEQUENCES OF NOT READING GUIDELINES

If you skip reading MASTER_GUIDELINES.md, you will:
- ‚ùå Miss critical error handling procedures
- ‚ùå Not follow the 6-Phase Workflow (required for every task)
- ‚ùå Risk running out of token budget mid-task
- ‚ùå Skip validation steps (causing failures later)
- ‚ùå Make mistakes that could have been avoided

**The guidelines exist to prevent failures. READ THEM FIRST.**
