## 📁 Files in This Directory

### 1. 00_VALIDATION_GATE_SYSTEM_CHECK.md
**Purpose**: Pre-implementation validation (50 checkpoints)

**MUST RUN FIRST**: Before any implementation work, run the validation script to ensure:
- Infrastructure is healthy
- All services are running
- Databases are accessible
- Dependencies are installed
- IBKR connection works

**Run**:
```bash
cd C:/ClaudeDesktop_Projects/Trade2026/docs/implementation
bash 00_VALIDATION_GATE_SYSTEM_CHECK.md  # Contains executable script
```

**Success**: 50/50 validations pass ✅
**Failure**: Fix issues before proceeding ❌

### 2. 01_CONSOLIDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md
**Purpose**: Complete 4-week implementation guide

**Contains**:
- Component architecture diagram
- Week-by-week implementation plan
- Component specifications with isolation boundaries
- Testing strategy (Component → Integration → E2E)
- Deployment procedures
- Validation checklists

**Follow ClaudeKnowledge Guidelines**:
- Component Isolation (Rule #1)
- 6-Phase Workflow (IMPLEMENT → TEST → INTEGRATE → TEST → DEPLOY → VALIDATE)
- Real-time documentation
- One change at a time

---

### 3. DATA_VENUES_NEEDS_WANTS_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose**: Complete list of data sources

**Categories**:
- 🔴 NEEDS (38 sources, $0/month) - Week 1-3
- 🟡 WANTS (20 sources, $0/month) - Week 4
- 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE (40 sources, $0/month) - Later

**Total**: 98 FREE data sources

---

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION_FRAMEWORK_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose**: High-level overview

**Contains**:
- What was created
- Implementation readiness checklist
- Alignment with ClaudeKnowledge guidelines
- Key implementation decisions
- Next steps

---

### 5. PHASE_6_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose**: Previous phase summary (for context)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Validate System
```bash
cd C:/ClaudeDesktop_Projects/Trade2026
bash docs/implementation/00_VALIDATION_GATE_SYSTEM_CHECK.md
```

**Expected Result**: `50/50 validations passed`

### Step 2: Start Implementation
Once validation passes, open:
```
01_CONSOLIDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md
```

Follow the **Week 1, Day 1** instructions to begin implementing the IBKR Adapter.

### Step 3: Follow 6-Phase Workflow
For EVERY component:
1. IMPLEMENT - Write code within component boundaries
2. TEST COMPONENT - Run component tests (mocked dependencies)
3. INTEGRATE - Connect to system
4. TEST AGAIN - Run integration tests (real dependencies)
5. DEPLOY - Deploy to Docker Compose
6. VALIDATE - Monitor for 5+ minutes

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Week 1**: All data adapters streaming
**Week 2**: All calculators producing scores
**Week 3**: Screener operational, API working
**Week 4**: Frontend dashboard complete

**Total**: 4 weeks, 13 components, $0/month

---

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

**Update DURING implementation** (not after):
- Session summaries (what was done today)
- Command logs (exact commands used)
- Architecture updates (component changes)
- GitHub commits (with context)

---

## 🆘 If Validation Fails

1. ❌ **STOP** - Do not proceed with implementation
2. Review failure messages
3. Fix issues systematically:
   - Infrastructure issues first
   - Then service issues
   - Then database connectivity
   - Then dependencies
4. Re-run validation
5. Only proceed when 50/50 pass
