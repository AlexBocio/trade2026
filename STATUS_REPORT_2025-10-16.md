## RECOMMENDATION

Based on this assessment:

**All P3 critical trading services (risk, oms, exeq) are HEALTHY** ✅
**Phase 2 Supporting services are ALL HEALTHY** ✅
**Core trading flow is OPERATIONAL** ✅

However, there are minor issues with:
- Data ingestion services (gateway, live-gateway)
- Some foundation services (normalizer)

**RECOMMENDATION**: **PROCEED TO PHASE 3**

The critical trading core is fully operational. The issues with gateway/normalizer are not blocking for Phase 3 frontend development. These can be addressed in parallel.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Proceed with Phase 3 Frontend Services** - All critical backend services are operational
2. **Fix gateway and normalizer health issues** - Can be done in parallel
3. **Consider adding PostgreSQL if needed** - Currently not blocking operations
