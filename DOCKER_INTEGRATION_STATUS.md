# Docker Integration Status Report

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Session**: Docker Integration + Validation Testing

## Summary

Successfully created Docker infrastructure for all 8 backend Python services but encountered a module import issue preventing container startup.

## Work Completed

### 1. Docker Infrastructure Created ✅

**Files Created**:

**Docker Images Built**: All 8 images successfully created (~680MB each)
- docker-portfolio-optimizer
- docker-rl-trading
- docker-advanced-backtest
- docker-factor-models
- docker-simulation-engine
- docker-fractional-diff
- docker-meta-labeling

### 2. Validation Scripts Created ✅

**validate_backend_services.py** (252 lines):
- Infrastructure health checks (NATS, QuestDB, ClickHouse, Valkey)
- Backend service health checks (all 8 services)
- Response time measurement
- Data fetcher integration test
- JSON report generation

**test_realtime_ibkr_data.py** (362 lines):

- Tests 5 backend services with IBKR symbols
- Validates hybrid IBKR+yfinance data fetcher
- JSON report generation

### 3. IBKR Documentation Complete ✅

**IBKR_SYMBOL_CAPACITY.md** (500+ lines):
- Direct answer: 100 symbols (standard), 200-500 (professional)
- Scanner API: 50 results per scan
- Current usage: 15/100 (85% available capacity)
- Cost analysis: $1.50/mo (current) vs $24,000/year (Bloomberg)
- Detailed scaling strategies and best practices

## Current Issue

### Problem: Module Import Error

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shared'`

**Root Cause**: The Docker build context is set to each individual service directory (e.g., `backend/portfolio_optimizer`), but the services try to import from `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py` which is outside the build context.

**Impact**: All 8 containers are in "Restarting" status and unable to start.

**Container Status**:
```
portfolio-optimizer       Restarting (1)
rl-trading                Restarting (1)
advanced-backtest         Restarting (1)
factor-models             Restarting (1)
simulation-engine         Restarting (1)
fractional-diff           Restarting (1)
meta-labeling             Restarting (1)
stock-screener            Restarting (1)
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Multi-Service Dockerfile (Recommended)

Change the docker-compose build context to the parent `backend` directory and modify the Dockerfile to copy both the shared module and the specific service directory.

**docker-compose.backend-services.yml changes**:
```yaml
portfolio-optimizer:
  build:
    context: ../../backend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend-service
    args:
      SERVICE_NAME: portfolio_optimizer
```

**Dockerfile changes**:
```dockerfile
ARG SERVICE_NAME
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser shared /app/shared
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser ${SERVICE_NAME} /app
WORKDIR /app
```

**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Shared module available to all services
- Minimal changes to docker-compose

**Cons**:
- Slightly more complex Dockerfile
- Need to rebuild all images

### Option 2: Copy Shared Module to Each Service

Copy the `backend/shared` directory into each service directory before building.

**Pros**:
- No Dockerfile changes needed
- Simple to implement

**Cons**:
- Code duplication
- Harder to maintain (changes to shared module require copying to all services)
- Not recommended for production

### Option 3: Install Shared as Package

Convert the shared module to an installable package and include it in requirements.txt.

**Pros**:
- Proper Python package structure
- Clean imports

**Cons**:
- Requires restructuring the shared module
- More complex setup
- May not be worth it for a single module

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate** (30-60 minutes):
1. Implement Option 1 (Multi-Service Dockerfile approach)
2. Update docker-compose.backend-services.yml to use `backend` as build context
3. Update Dockerfile to accept SERVICE_NAME build arg
4. Rebuild all 8 Docker images
5. Start containers and verify they run successfully

**After Containers Start** (30-45 minutes):
6. Run `validate_backend_services.py` to verify all 8 services are healthy
7. Run `test_realtime_ibkr_data.py` to test with real-time IBKR data
8. Create final deployment summary document

---

## Architecture Notes

### Before (Native Python)
- 8 Python processes running independently
- Direct access to backend/shared module via relative imports
- No isolation or health checks

### After (Docker - Target State)
- 8 Docker containers with orchestration
- Isolated environments with health checks
- Auto-restart on failure
- Network isolation (backend + lowlatency networks)
- Shared module needs to be explicitly included in build context

## Files Modified This Session

**Created**:
1. `backend/Dockerfile.backend-service`
2. `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.backend-services.yml`
3. `validate_backend_services.py`
4. `test_realtime_ibkr_data.py`
5. `IBKR_SYMBOL_CAPACITY.md`
6. `DOCKER_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
7. `DOCKER_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` (this file)

**Modified**:
- `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.backend-services.yml` (removed depends_on, marked networks as external)

---

## Testing Status

- [x] Docker images built successfully (all 8)
- [x] Containers created successfully
- [ ] Containers running (BLOCKED by shared module import issue)
- [ ] Validation tests passed
- [ ] IBKR real-time data tests passed

**Completion**: ~80% (blocked on module import fix)

## Next Session Prompt

**Continue Docker Integration - Fix Module Import Issue**

"The Docker containers for the 8 backend services have been built but are failing to start due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shared'`. The issue is that the build context is set to each individual service directory, but the services need access to `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py`.

Please implement Option 1 (Multi-Service Dockerfile) by:
1. Updating `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.backend-services.yml` to use `context: ../../backend` for all 8 services
2. Adding a `SERVICE_NAME` build arg to each service
3. Updating `backend/Dockerfile.backend-service` to:
   - Accept the SERVICE_NAME build arg
   - Copy the shared directory to /app/shared
   - Copy the specific service directory to /app
4. Rebuild all 8 Docker images
5. Start the containers and verify they run successfully
6. Run validation tests: `python validate_backend_services.py`
7. Run IBKR data tests: `python test_realtime_ibkr_data.py`

Current status: Docker images built, containers failing to start. Next step: Fix shared module import issue."
