# IBKR Subscription Limit Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Phase:** 6 - Data Ingestion
**Issue:** Error 101 - Max number of tickers reached

## Problem Statement

After expanding symbol collection from 62 to 169 symbols, IBKR paper trading account rejected 46 symbols with **Error 101: "Max number of tickers has been reached"**.

## Investigation Results

### Subscription Statistics

| Metric | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Total Symbols Configured** | 169 | Across 5 tiers |
| **Subscription Attempts** | 169 | All symbols attempted |
| **Error 101 Failures** | 46 | ~27% rejection rate |
| **Successful Subscriptions** | ~123 | Estimated (169 - 46) |
| **IBKR Paper Limit** | ~100-123 | Undocumented limit |

### Failed Symbols (46 total - All from Tier 5)

```
AWAY, BETZ, BIBL, BITO, BKCH, BLOK, CATH, DEFI, EATZ, EMLP,
EPHE, ESPO, FNDX, GLBL, GOVZ, HERO, HOMZ, ISRA, JEPI, LRNZ,
LUXE, MILN, NERD, PAWZ, PBJ, PETZ, PINK, PSIL, QYLD, ROKT,
SEA, SHE, SPCX, SRVR, TIPZ, TOLZ, TUR, UFO, USAI, VICE,
WELL, WGMI, WOMN, XAR, YALL, YOLO
```

### Subscription Success by Tier

| Tier | Symbols | Status | Success Rate |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Tier 1 (Core Sectors)** | 11 | ✅ 100% | All subscribed |
| **Tier 1 (Benchmarks)** | 4 | ✅ 100% | All subscribed |
| **Tier 2 (Sub-Sectors)** | 23 | ✅ 100% | All subscribed |
| **Tier 3 (Thematic)** | 16 | ✅ 100% | All subscribed |
| **Tier 4 (Commodities)** | 8 | ✅ 100% | All subscribed |
| **Tier 5 (Niche)** | 107 | ⚠️ 57% | ~61/107 subscribed |
| **TOTAL** | **169** | **73%** | **~123/169 subscribed** |

### QuestDB Verification

Query: `SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM market_data_l1`

**Result:** Only 7 symbols with data (from previous session):
- XLE, XLF, XLI, XLK, XLP, XLV, XLY

**Note:** Current session data not captured (market closed on Sunday).

## Root Cause

### IBKR Paper Trading Limits

**Market Data Subscription Limits:**
- **Paper Trading:** ~100-123 simultaneous subscriptions (undocumented)
- **Live Trading:** Typically higher limits, varies by subscription level
- **Paid Market Data:** May increase limits (requires verification)

**Subscription Behavior:**
1. IBKR accepts subscriptions sequentially
2. After reaching limit, returns Error 101 for subsequent requests
3. No graceful degradation or prioritization
4. Adapter logs "Subscribed to" before IBKR confirms (misleading)

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Services (Not Affected)

✅ **Tier 1-4 symbols (62 total) fully operational:**
- Sector rotation analysis (11 core sectors + 4 benchmarks)
- Sub-sector early indicators (23 symbols)
- Thematic momentum (16 symbols)
- Commodity inflation hedges (8 symbols)

### Affected Services

⚠️ **Tier 5 partial coverage (57%):**
- Niche thematic ETFs: 61/107 subscribed
- Missing ~43% of narrative acceleration signals
- No rotation mechanism implemented

## Solution Options

### Option A: Accept Current Limits (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Tier 1-4 fully functional (62 symbols - core requirements met)
- No code changes required
- Tier 5 provides partial coverage (61 symbols still valuable)

**Cons:**
- Missing 46 Tier 5 symbols
- No dynamic rotation

**Use Case:** Acceptable for Phase 6-7 development and testing

---

### Option B: Implement Priority-Based Subscription with Rotation

**Approach:**
1. Prioritize Tiers 1-4 (always subscribe)
2. Subscribe Tier 5 symbols up to limit
3. Implement hourly/daily rotation for Tier 5 symbols
4. Track which Tier 5 symbols are currently subscribed

**Implementation:**
- Modify `ibkr_adapter.py` to add priority ordering
- Add Tier 5 rotation scheduler (cron job or background task)
- Update config.yaml with Tier 5 priority order

**Pros:**
- Ensures Tier 1-4 always available
- Eventual coverage of all Tier 5 symbols over time
- Flexible configuration

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity
- Requires state management for rotations
- Tier 5 data will be intermittent

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### Option C: Use Multiple Client IDs

**Approach:**
- Connect to IBKR with 2-3 client IDs
- Distribute symbols across clients:
  - Client 10: Tiers 1-4 (62 symbols)
  - Client 11: Tier 5 Part 1 (54 symbols)
  - Client 12: Tier 5 Part 2 (53 symbols)

**Pros:**
- All 169 symbols subscribed simultaneously
- No rotation complexity
- Better fault isolation

**Cons:**
- Requires multiple adapter instances
- Increased resource usage (memory, connections)
- May violate IBKR terms (needs verification)

**Effort:** 6-8 hours

---

### Option D: Upgrade to Live Account or Paid Subscriptions

**Approach:**
- Switch from paper trading to live account
- Purchase additional market data subscriptions

**Pros:**
- Higher subscription limits
- Professional-grade data
- No technical workarounds

**Cons:**
- **Monthly costs:** $10-50/month for market data
- Requires live account (potential real-money exposure)
- May still have limits (needs verification)

**Effort:** 1-2 hours (setup), ongoing costs

## Recommended Solution

### Immediate Action (Option A)

**Accept current limits and proceed with Phase 6-7:**
- Tier 1-4: 62 symbols fully operational ✅
- Tier 5: 61/107 symbols providing partial coverage ✅
- Document limitation in system status
- Revisit in Phase 8-9 if Tier 5 full coverage becomes critical

### Future Enhancement (Option B - Phase 8-9)

**Implement rotation strategy when needed:**
- Priority order for Tier 5 symbols based on:
  - Trading volume (higher priority)
  - Narrative momentum (trending themes)
  - User-defined watchlist
- Rotate subscriptions every 4-8 hours
- Maintain subscription state in Valkey

## Configuration Changes Required

### Option A (No Changes)

Current configuration acceptable for development.

### Option B (Priority + Rotation)

Add to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# IBKR Configuration
ibkr:
  # ... existing config ...

  # Subscription priority and rotation
  subscription_priority:
    tier1_sectors: 1      # Always subscribe
    tier1_benchmarks: 1   # Always subscribe
    tier2_subsectors: 2   # Always subscribe
    tier3_thematic: 3     # Always subscribe
    tier4_commodities: 4  # Always subscribe
    tier5_niche: 5        # Subscribe remaining capacity, rotate

  tier5_rotation:
    enabled: true
    interval_hours: 4     # Rotate every 4 hours
    symbols_per_rotation: 50  # Subscribe 50 at a time
```

Add priority order to Tier 5 symbols:

```yaml
symbols:
  niche_thematic_etfs_priority_order:
    high_priority:  # Subscribe first (top 30)
      - ARKW, BOTZ, LIT, BATT, GDX, URA, MJ, MSOS, BITO, BLOK
      - PAVE, DFEN, HERO, LUXE, PETZ, ROKT, UFO, ...

    medium_priority:  # Subscribe second (30)
      - KOMP, SNSR, ACES, GRID, CGW, REMX, URNM, PSY, DATA, QYLD
      - JEPI, WGMI, FINX, AWAY, BETZ, ESPO, PBJ, ...

    low_priority:  # Rotate as capacity available (47)
      - XT, DRIV, BUGZ, FIW, KRBN, GRN, CUT, SIL, WEAT, CORN
      - SOYB, JO, CANE, KBWB, YOLO, HOMZ, NFTZ, SPCX, ...
```

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Verify Current State

1. ✅ Confirmed 169 symbols loaded
2. ✅ Confirmed 46 Error 101 failures
3. ✅ Confirmed Tier 1-4 fully subscribed
4. ⏳ Verify data flow during market hours

### Phase 2: Option A Testing

1. Run during market hours (Monday 9:30 AM ET)
2. Verify ~123 symbols receiving real-time data
3. Validate QuestDB writes for all subscribed symbols
4. Monitor for 1 week

### Phase 3: Option B Implementation (If Needed)

1. Implement priority subscription logic
2. Implement rotation scheduler
3. Test rotation transitions (no data loss)
4. Monitor for 2 weeks

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Subscription Success Rate:** Target >95% for Tiers 1-4, >50% for Tier 5
- **Error 101 Count:** Monitor daily, alert if Tier 1-4 affected
- **QuestDB Write Rate:** 123 symbols * ~1 update/sec = ~123 writes/sec
- **Tier 5 Coverage:** Track which symbols currently subscribed

### Alerts

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "IBKR Tier 1-4 Subscription Failure"
    condition: "Error 101 for any Tier 1-4 symbol"
    severity: CRITICAL
    action: "Page on-call engineer"

  - name: "IBKR Tier 5 Coverage Below 50%"
    condition: "Tier 5 subscription rate < 50%"
    severity: WARNING
    action: "Log for investigation"
```
