# IBKR Gateway Setup Guide for Trade2026

## Prerequisites
- IB Gateway or TWS installed
- Valid IBKR account (live or paper trading)

---

## Step 1: Enable API Connections in IB Gateway

### Open IB Gateway Configuration
1. Launch **IB Gateway** (not TWS, unless you prefer TWS)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Global Configuration** ‚Üí **API** ‚Üí **Settings**

### Configure API Settings
Enable these settings:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients** | ‚úÖ Checked | Allows external applications to connect |
| **Socket Port** | **4002** | Port for IB Gateway (4001 for TWS) |
| **Master API Client ID** | Leave empty or set to 0 | Allow any client ID |
| **Read-Only API** | ‚ùå Unchecked | Trade2026 needs write access for orders |
| **Download open orders on connection** | ‚úÖ Checked | See existing orders |

### Add Trusted IP Addresses
**CRITICAL**: Add these IPs to allow Docker containers to connect:

```
127.0.0.1
192.168.65.254
192.168.65.0/24
```

**How to add**:
1. In API Settings, find **Trusted IP Addresses** section
2. Click **Add** or enter in the text field
3. Add all three addresses above
4. Click **OK** to save

---

## Step 2: Configure Socket Port

### IB Gateway Port Configuration
- **IB Gateway**: Port **4002** (default)
- **TWS (Trader Workstation)**: Port **4001**

If using TWS instead of Gateway, update Trade2026 config:
```yaml
# backend/apps/data_ingestion/config/config.yaml
ibkr:
  port: 4001  # Change from 4002 to 4001 for TWS
```

---

## Step 3: Test Connection from Windows Host

Before testing from Docker, verify IB Gateway API is accessible:

```powershell
# Test TCP connection
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 4002
```

Expected output:
```
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Trade2026 Connection

### Check Connection Status
```bash
# From project root
docker logs trade2026-data-ingestion --tail 30
```

**Success indicators**:
```
INFO - Connected to Valkey
INFO - Connected to QuestDB
INFO - Connecting to host.docker.internal:4002 with clientId 10...
INFO - Connected
INFO - Subscribed to 15 symbols
INFO - IBKR Adapter: CONNECTED
```

**Failure indicators**:
```
ERROR - API connection failed: ConnectionRefusedError
ERROR - API connection failed: TimeoutError
```

### Check Data Flow
```bash
# Verify data is being written to QuestDB
docker exec trade2026-questdb /app/bin/psql -d qdb -c "SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as ticks, MAX(timestamp) as latest FROM market_data_l1 WHERE timestamp > now() - interval '5 minutes' GROUP BY symbol ORDER BY latest DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

---

## Step 5: Monitor Connection Status

### Via Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/health
```

Expected response when connected:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ibkr_status": "connected",
  "ibkr_connected_at": "2025-10-23T20:45:30Z",
  "symbols_subscribed": 15,
  "last_tick_received": "2025-10-23T20:50:15Z"
}
```

### Via Website Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/status`

You'll see:
- **IBKR Connection**: üü¢ Connected / üî¥ Disconnected
- **Last Tick**: timestamp
- **Symbols**: 15 subscribed

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Connection Refused"
**Cause**: IB Gateway not running or API not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Ensure IB Gateway is running
2. Check API ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients is checked
3. Restart IB Gateway after changing settings

### Problem: "TimeoutError" (most common)
**Cause**: API enabled but trusted IPs not configured

**Fix**:
1. Go to API ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Trusted IP Addresses
2. Add `192.168.65.254` and `192.168.65.0/24`
3. Click OK to save
4. Restart data-ingestion service: `docker-compose restart data-ingestion`

### Problem: "API Error 326: Unable to connect"
**Cause**: Too many active API connections

**Fix**:
1. IB allows only 32 simultaneous API connections
2. Close other applications using IBKR API
3. Set unique client_id in config.yaml (default: 10)

### Problem: "Market data not flowing"
**Cause**: Market data subscriptions not active

**Fix**:
1. Check your IBKR account has market data subscriptions
2. For paper trading, market data is delayed 15 minutes by default
3. Verify symbols in config.yaml are valid
