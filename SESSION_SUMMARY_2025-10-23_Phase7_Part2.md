# Session Summary: Phase 7 Testing & Validation - Part 2
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Phase**: 7 - Testing & Validation
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: ‚úÖ Major Progress - 2 Critical Blockers Resolved

---

## üéØ Session Objectives

1. Continue Phase 7 testing from previous session
2. Resolve critical QuestDB Docker networking blocker
3. Debug and fix yfinance fallback failure
4. Rebuild all backend services with fixes

---

## ‚úÖ Work Completed

### 1. QuestDB Docker Networking Fix (CRITICAL - 1 hour)

**Problem**: Services used hardcoded `localhost:9000` for QuestDB, causing "Connection refused" errors inside Docker containers.

**Solution**:
- Updated `docker-compose.backend-services.yml`: Added `QUESTDB_URL=http://questdb:9000` environment variable to all 8 services
- Updated `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py`: Changed from hardcoded localhost to environment variable
- Used Docker service discovery (`questdb:9000`) instead of `localhost:9000`

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.backend-services.yml` - Added QUESTDB_URL to 8 services
- `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py` - Lines 36-37: Use `os.getenv("QUESTDB_URL", "http://questdb:9000")`

**Testing**: All 8 services showing HEALTHY status, QuestDB connectivity working

**Git Commit**: `1d3051a` - "fix: QuestDB Docker Networking - CRITICAL Blocker Resolved"

---

### 2. yfinance MultiIndex Data Structure Fix (CRITICAL - 1.5 hours)

**Problem**: yfinance v0.2.66 changed to auto-adjust prices by default and now returns MultiIndex DataFrame with `('Price', 'TICKER')` structure instead of `'Adj Close'` column. Old code returned empty DataFrames.

**Investigation**:
- Tested yfinance from inside Docker container - working correctly
- Analyzed DataFrame structure - MultiIndex with 2 levels
- Identified issue: Code looking for 'Adj Close' which doesn't exist

**Solution**:
- Updated `fetch_from_yfinance()` in `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py` (lines 124-170)
- Detect MultiIndex structure (`data.columns.nlevels == 2`)
- Extract 'Close' prices from first level: `data['Close']`
- Maintain backward compatibility with older yfinance versions

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/shared/data_fetcher.py` - Lines 124-170: Updated to handle MultiIndex
- `test_yfinance_fix.py` - NEW: Test script for yfinance fallback

**Testing**:
```python
# Test from inside Docker container:
prices = fetch_prices(['AAPL', 'MSFT'], start='2024-01-01', end='2024-01-10')
# Result: DataFrame with 6 rows √ó 2 columns ‚úÖ
```

**Git Commit**: `914e0c2` - "fix: yfinance MultiIndex data structure handling"

## üîß Technical Details

### QuestDB Connectivity Fix

**Before**:
```python
# backend/shared/data_fetcher.py (lines 34-36)
QUESTDB_HOST = "localhost"
QUESTDB_PORT = 9000
QUESTDB_URL = f"http://{QUESTDB_HOST}:{QUESTDB_PORT}"
```

**After**:
```python
# backend/shared/data_fetcher.py (lines 36-37)
import os
QUESTDB_URL = os.getenv("QUESTDB_URL", "http://questdb:9000")
```

**docker-compose.backend-services.yml**:
```yaml
environment:
  - SERVICE_NAME=Portfolio Optimizer
  - SERVICE_PORT=5000
  - QUESTDB_URL=http://questdb:9000  # ADDED
  - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

### yfinance MultiIndex Fix

**Before**:
```python
# Looked for 'Adj Close' which doesn't exist in new yfinance
if 'Adj Close' in data.columns:
    return data['Adj Close']
```

**After**:
```python
# Handle MultiIndex structure
if data.columns.nlevels == 2:
    if 'Close' in data.columns.get_level_values(0):
        return data['Close']  # Extract Close prices from MultiIndex
else:
    # Fallback for older yfinance versions
    if 'Close' in data.columns:
        return data['Close']
    elif 'Adj Close' in data.columns:
        return data['Adj Close']
```

## üí° Key Learnings

### Docker Networking Best Practices
- Use Docker service names (e.g., `questdb:9000`) instead of `localhost`
- Configure via environment variables for flexibility
- Test connectivity from inside containers, not just from host

### yfinance Library Changes
- yfinance v0.2.66 introduced breaking changes
- Returns MultiIndex DataFrame by default
- Need to handle both old and new data structures for compatibility

### Documentation Cascade Discipline
- Following the mandatory 7-step process ensures consistency
- Master Plan and Completion Tracker must always be updated together
- Session summaries are critical for continuity

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Notes

This session successfully resolved 2 of the 3 critical blockers identified in the previous session:
1. ‚úÖ QuestDB Docker networking (CRITICAL)
2. ‚úÖ yfinance fallback failure (HIGH)
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Limited historical data (MEDIUM - next priority)

The documentation cascade was followed correctly throughout the session, ensuring all master documents remain synchronized. Both fixes were tested and verified before committing.

The backend services rebuild is taking longer than expected due to the large torch package (RL Trading service), but 6/8 services have completed successfully. The rebuild will be completed in the next session.

**Next Session Focus**: Complete rebuild, then prioritize historical data backfill to enable full backend service testing.
