## Structure

### old_sessions/
Session handoff files and phase-specific validation results from previous development sessions. These are historical records of work progress but have been superseded by:
- `SYSTEM_STATUS_2025-10-20.md` (current comprehensive status)
- `QUICK_HANDOFF.md` (current handoff)
- `COMPLETION_TRACKER_UPDATED.md` (current progress tracking)

### old_documentation/
Old planning documents, status reports, and README variants that are no longer current. These include:
- Historical status reports (CURRENT_STATUS_*, EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_*, etc.)
- Old planning documents (00_MASTER_INTEGRATION_PLAN, MASTER_UPDATE_PLAN, etc.)
- Superseded trackers and summaries
- Old README variants (README_CLEAN, README_FINAL, START_HERE, etc.)

## Current Active Documentation

The main project folder now contains only active documentation:
- `README.md` - Main project readme
- `README_START_HERE.md` - Entry point for new users
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` - 8-phase integration roadmap
- `SYSTEM_STATUS_2025-10-20.md` - Latest comprehensive system audit

## Why Archive?

These files were archived to:
1. Keep the main project folder clean and focused
2. Preserve historical development records
3. Make it easier to find current documentation
4. Reduce clutter for new team members

## Accessing Archived Files

All files are preserved and can be accessed if needed. However, they are considered outdated and should not be used for current development guidance.
