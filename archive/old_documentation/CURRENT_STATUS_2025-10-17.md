### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified:

1. **Performance Gaps**
   - Risk service: Not meeting 1.5ms SLA
   - OMS: ~250ms vs 10ms SLA
   - Overall: ~4 orders/sec vs 1000/sec target

2. **Health Check Issues**
   - PNL service: Functional but health check failing
   - Sink services: Writing data but reporting unhealthy

3. **Missing Components**
   - Frontend not deployed
   - ML services not started
   - Performance optimization needed

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSIONS

1. **System is more complete than documented** - 75% backend vs 25% reported
2. **Functional but not performant** - Trading works but too slow
3. **Frontend is the main gap** - Backend mostly complete
4. **Documentation needs major update** - Reality differs significantly
5. **Good foundation for completion** - Most hard work done
