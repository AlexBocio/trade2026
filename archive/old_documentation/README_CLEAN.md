# Trade2026 Integration Project

**Status**: 📋 Ready for Instruction Generation
**Timeline**: 3-8 weeks (MVP in 3-4 weeks)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14

---

## 🎯 What This Is

Unifying THREE separate systems into one platform:

1. **Backend** (C:\Trade2025\) - 20+ microservices, operational
2. **Frontend** (C:\GUI\) - React app, 50+ pages, complete  
3. **ML Pipelines** - Strategy library (to be built)

**Result**: Single platform in `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\`

## 📁 Project Files

### Quick Start (Read These First)

**`MASTER_PLAN.md`** (~500 words)
- One-page overview
- 8-phase breakdown
- Quick decision guide

### Detailed References

**`appendices/`** Directory:
- `appendix_A_foundation.md` - Phase 1 details
- More appendices will be created as needed

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Read the Plan (5 minutes)
```bash
# Open and read
MASTER_PLAN.md
```

### 2. Choose Your Path

**Option A: Start Small** (Recommended)
- Generate 5 instructions (Phase 1 only)
- Test the approach
- Continue if successful

**Option B: MVP Commitment**
- Generate 23 instructions (Phases 1-3)
- Backend + Frontend integration
- 3-4 weeks

**Option C: Full Build**
- Generate 45 instructions (All phases)
- Complete platform with ML
- 6-8 weeks

### 3. Tell Claude
Just say:
- "Generate Phase 1 instructions" (Option A)
- "Generate MVP instructions" (Option B)  
- "Generate all instructions" (Option C)
