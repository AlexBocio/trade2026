## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Continue Phase 2 (Recommended)

**Complete remaining backend services** (34 hours):

```
Next: Task 03 - Migrate exeq, pnl, risk (7h)
Then: Task 04 - Migrate risk, oms (14h) - CRITICAL
Then: Task 05 - Migrate ptrc + 5 others (13h)
Result: Backend MVP complete
```

**Start with**:
```
Read instructions/PHASE2_PROMPT03_MIGRATE_P2_SERVICES.md
Migrate exeq service first
```

### Option 2: Jump to Critical Services

**Get trading core working** (14 hours):

```
Task 04: Migrate risk + oms
These are critical for any trading
Must pass CRITICAL validation gate
```

### Option 3: Start Phase 3

**Begin frontend integration** (if enough backend services):

```
Read instructions/PHASE3_PROMPT00_VALIDATION_GATE.md
Validate backend ready
Then start frontend integration
```
