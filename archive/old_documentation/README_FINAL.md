# Trade2026 Integration Project

**Status**: 📋 Ready for Phase 1
**Timeline**: 3-8 weeks (MVP in 3-4 weeks)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14

## 🎯 What This Is

Unifying THREE separate systems into one platform:

1. **Backend** (C:\Trade2025\) - 20+ microservices, operational
2. **Frontend** (C:\GUI\) - React app, 50+ pages, complete  
3. **ML Pipelines** - Strategy library (to be built)

**Result**: Single platform in `C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Create unified directory structure and core infrastructure

**Instructions Ready**:
1. `01_CREATE_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Setup folders
2. `02_SETUP_DOCKER_NETWORKS.md` - Configure networks
3. `03_MIGRATE_CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` - Move core services
4. `04_CONFIGURE_BASE_COMPOSE.md` - Setup docker-compose
5. `05_VALIDATE_CORE_SERVICES.md` - Test everything works

**Time**: 1 day (with troubleshooting)

**Next Steps**:
1. Read instructions in order
2. Execute with Claude Code
3. Validate all core services healthy
4. Proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 1 Tasks

- [ ] Task 01: Create directory structure
- [ ] Task 02: Setup Docker networks
- [ ] Task 03: Migrate core infrastructure
- [ ] Task 04: Configure base compose
- [ ] Task 05: Validate core services

## 📚 Documentation

**Quick Reference**:
- **MASTER_PLAN.md** - Overall strategy and all phases
- **appendices/appendix_A_foundation.md** - Phase 1 detailed guide

**For Claude Code**:
- Read instructions sequentially
- Follow 6-Phase Workflow for each task
- Update this README after each task completion

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When**:
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Docker networks configured
- ✅ 8/8 core services healthy (NATS, Valkey, QuestDB, ClickHouse, SeaweedFS, OpenSearch, authn, OPA)
- ✅ All health checks passing
- ✅ Services can communicate

**Then**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Backend Migration)

---

## 💡 Key Principles

✅ **Sequential**: Complete one task before next
✅ **Test**: Validate after each task
✅ **Document**: Record issues and solutions
✅ **Modular**: Can stop/start at any phase

---

**Ready for Phase 1 execution!** 🚀

**Next**: Start with `instructions/01_CREATE_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`
