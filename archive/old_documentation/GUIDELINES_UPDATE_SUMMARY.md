# ✅ ALL INSTRUCTIONS UPDATED WITH PROMINENT GUIDELINES

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Update**: Added impossible-to-miss "STOP - READ THIS FIRST" sections

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### Problem
Claude Code was skipping the "Required Reading" section and jumping straight to code execution, missing critical guidelines about:
- Read Before Write
- 6-Phase Workflow
- Token budget limits
- Error handling
- Testing requirements

### Solution
Added **prominent, impossible-to-miss** section at the top of EVERY task instruction:

```
# 🛑 STOP - READ THIS FIRST 🛑

## MANDATORY READING BEFORE ANY CODE EXECUTION

**Claude Code**: You MUST read these files IN FULL before starting any work. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
```

## 📊 Reading Time Breakdown

| Task | Guidelines | Project Context | Source Files | Total |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| 01 | 10 min | 5 min | - | **~15 min** |
| 02 | 10 min | 5 min | - | **~15 min** |
| 03 | 15 min | 10 min | 5 min | **~25 min** |
| 04 | 10 min | 5 min | - | **~15 min** |
| 05 | 10 min | 5 min | - | **~15 min** |

**Total Reading Time for Phase 1**: ~85 minutes (~1.5 hours)

**But this prevents**: Hours of debugging, rollbacks, and restarts!

## ✅ What Claude Code Will See

### Before (Easy to Skip)
```markdown
## 📚 REQUIRED READING BEFORE STARTING

### Universal Guidelines
Read these sections from MASTER_GUIDELINES.md:
- [ ] Some section
- [ ] Another section
```
❌ Claude Code skipped this and jumped to code

### After (Impossible to Miss)
```markdown
# 🛑 STOP - READ THIS FIRST 🛑

## MANDATORY READING BEFORE ANY CODE EXECUTION

**Claude Code**: You MUST read these files IN FULL 
before starting any work. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### 1. MASTER_GUIDELINES.md (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)
**Location**: C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\ClaudeKnowledge\MASTER_GUIDELINES.md

**YOU MUST READ THESE SECTIONS** (use file_read tool):
- [ ] New Session Startup Protocol
- [ ] Core Development Rules
- [ ] 6-Phase Mandatory Workflow
...

## ⚠️ CONSEQUENCES OF NOT READING GUIDELINES

If you skip reading MASTER_GUIDELINES.md, you will:
- ❌ Miss critical error handling procedures
- ❌ Not follow 6-Phase Workflow (task will fail)
...

## ✅ CHECKLIST BEFORE PROCEEDING

**I confirm I have read and understood**:
- [ ] MASTER_GUIDELINES.md - New Session Startup Protocol
- [ ] MASTER_GUIDELINES.md - Core Development Rules
...

**Only proceed to next section after completing this checklist.**
```
✅ Much harder to skip!
