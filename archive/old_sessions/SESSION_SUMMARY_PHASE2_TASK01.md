## üìä KEY FINDINGS

### Services Discovered
- **Total**: 18 application services
- **Core Infrastructure**: 8 services (already migrated in Phase 1)
- **Operational Status**: 89% (16/18 healthy in Trade2025)

### Migration Scope
- **MVP (P1-P4)**: 13 services, 46 hours (~6 working days)
- **Full (P1-P5)**: 18 services, 68 hours (~9 working days)
- **Recommended**: Start with MVP, defer P5 to Phase 4

### Critical Path Services
1. **normalizer** - Data aggregation (critical for all downstream)
2. **oms** - Order management (central trading hub)
3. **risk** - Pre-trade checks (cannot block order flow)
4. **live-gateway** - Exchange connectivity (execution)

### Performance Requirements Identified
- **Risk Service**: P50 ‚â§ 1.5ms (CRITICAL SLA)
- **OMS**: P50 ‚â§ 10ms, P99 ‚â§ 50ms
- **Normalizer**: 100k ticks/sec throughput
- **Overall System**: 1000 orders/sec sustained

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### What Went Well
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Backend briefing provided excellent detail
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Service relationships well-documented
3. **Logical Prioritization**: P1-P5 follows dependency chain
4. **Realistic Estimates**: 3.8 hours average per service is achievable
5. **Risk Awareness**: High-risk services identified early

### Challenges Identified
1. **Complex Dependencies**: OMS depends on many services
2. **Performance Critical**: Risk service has strict latency SLA (1.5ms)
3. **External APIs**: Gateway and live-gateway need external connectivity
4. **Multi-Lane Networking**: 6 services span multiple CPGS lanes
5. **Configuration Volume**: Each service needs extensive config

### Recommendations
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with P1 services (no app dependencies)
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validation gates are critical for high-risk services
3. **Keep Trade2025 Running**: Don't shut down until validation complete
4. **Paper Trading First**: Validate trading services in paper mode
5. **Monitor Performance**: Benchmark each service as migrated

## üéØ DECISION POINTS

### Proceed to Task 02?
**Decision**: ‚úÖ YES

**Rationale**:
- Task 01 complete with all acceptance criteria met
- Phase 1 validation passed (26/26)
- Priority 1 services clearly defined
- No blockers identified
- Comprehensive documentation available
- Clear migration path established

### MVP vs Full Migration?
**Recommendation**: **MVP First (P1-P4)**

**Rationale**:
- MVP includes all critical trading services
- P5 services are ML/optional features
- Can defer P5 to Phase 4 (ML Library)
- Focus on core functionality first
- 46 hours vs 68 hours (saves 22 hours)

---

## üìù LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Read Documentation First**: Backend briefing was invaluable
2. **Validation Gates Matter**: Catching issues early is critical
3. **Dependencies Drive Order**: Can't migrate OMS before risk service
4. **Performance is Critical**: Risk service latency is non-negotiable
5. **Documentation Quality**: Clear docs enable fast migration
