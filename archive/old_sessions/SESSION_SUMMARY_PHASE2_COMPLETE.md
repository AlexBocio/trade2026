### 5. Updated Tracker ✅
**File**: `COMPLETION_TRACKER.md`
**Status**: Phase 2 Task 01 complete, Tasks 02-06 outlined

---

## 📋 MIGRATION APPROACH

### Universal Pattern (All Services)

Every service migration follows this **10-step process**:

```
1. COPY source code from Trade2025
2. CREATE configuration (config.yaml)
3. UPDATE code (localhost → Docker service names)
4. BUILD Docker image
5. ADD to docker-compose.apps.yml
6. TEST component (isolated)
7. TEST integration (with dependencies)
8. VALIDATE performance (benchmarks)
9. VALIDATE gate (proceed/stop decision)
10. UPDATE tracker (mark complete)
```

**This pattern is documented in detail** for Task 02 and applies to all remaining tasks.

---

## 🎯 WHAT'S READY FOR EXECUTION

### Immediate Execution Ready ✅

**Task 02: Priority 1 Services**
- ✅ Complete step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Configuration templates
- ✅ Dockerfile templates
- ✅ Test plans
- ✅ Validation gates
- ✅ docker-compose entries ready

**What's Needed**:
- Manual: Copy source code from C:\Trade2025\
- Manual: Execute each step
- Manual: Run tests
- Manual: Validate

---

### Pattern Replication for Tasks 03-06

**Tasks 03-06** follow the **same pattern** as Task 02:

```
Task 03 (P2): gateway, live-gateway → Same 10-step process
Task 04 (P3): risk, oms → Same 10-step process + CRITICAL GATE
Task 05 (P4): ptrc, feast-pipeline, + 4 services → Same process
Task 06 (P5): 5 ML services → Same process (OPTIONAL)
```

**Everything is documented**:
- docker-compose.apps.yml has ALL service definitions
- PHASE2_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md explains the approach
- BACKEND_SERVICES_INVENTORY.md has all service details

---

## 🔒 VALIDATION GATES

### After Every Task

**Mandatory Validation**:
1. All services running ✅
2. Health checks passing ✅
3. Integration tests passing ✅
4. Performance benchmarks met ✅
5. No errors ✅
6. Documentation updated ✅

**Decision**: Proceed to next task? YES/NO

---

### Critical Gate: After Task 04 (Trading Core)

**COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION REQUIRED**:

```
Full Trading Flow Test:
├─ Submit order via OMS
├─ Risk check (< 1.5ms latency)
├─ Order routed to live-gateway
├─ Order status updates
├─ Position tracking
├─ Fill processing
└─ Data persistence

Load Test:
├─ 1000 orders/sec sustained (5 min)
├─ OMS: P50 < 10ms, P99 < 50ms
├─ Risk: P50 < 1.5ms (CRITICAL)
└─ No errors or crashes
```

**Only proceed if ALL validation passes**

---

## 📊 MVP SCOPE

### What's Included (Recommended)

**Tasks 02-05** (P1-P4):
- 13 services
- 46 hours
- Core trading functionality
- **Result**: Fully operational platform

### What's Excluded (Optional)

**Task 06** (P5):
- 5 ML services
- 22 hours
- Can defer to Phase 4 (ML Library)
- **Recommendation**: Skip for MVP

---

## 🚀 EXECUTION TIMELINE

### Recommended Schedule

**Week 1** (40 hours):
- Days 1-2: Task 02 (P1, 8h) - Foundation services
- Days 3-4: Task 03 (P2, 11h) - Data ingestion
- Day 5: Task 04 start (P3, 14h) - Trading core

**Week 2** (40 hours):
- Days 1-2: Task 04 complete + CRITICAL VALIDATION
- Day 3: Task 05 start (P4, 13h) - Supporting services
- Days 4-5: Task 05 complete + Final validation

**Result**: MVP complete in 2 weeks

**Optional Week 3**:
- Task 06 (P5, 22h) - ML services if needed

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Follow

1. **Never use localhost** - Always Docker service names
2. **Validate before proceeding** - Every task has a gate
3. **Test thoroughly** - Component + Integration + Performance
4. **Keep Trade2025 running** - Rollback capability
5. **Paper trading first** - For trading services
6. **Monitor latency** - Risk service critical (< 1.5ms)
7. **Load test** - Before production (1000 orders/sec)
8. **Document everything** - Update tracker continuously
