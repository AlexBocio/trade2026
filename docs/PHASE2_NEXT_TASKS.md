# Phase 2 Next Tasks - Quick Reference

**Current Status**: Task 02 (P1 Services) in progress with Claude Code  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Purpose**: Quick reference for remaining Phase 2 tasks

---

## üìã PHASE 2 TASK SEQUENCE

### ‚úÖ Task 01: Survey (COMPLETE)
**Time**: 2 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Done  
**Result**: 18 services documented, priorities established

---

### ‚è≥ Task 02: P1 Services (IN PROGRESS)
**File**: `PHASE2_02_MIGRATE_P1_SERVICES.md`  
**Services**: normalizer, sink-ticks, sink-alt  
**Time**: 8 hours  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Claude Code is implementing this now  
**Next**: Wait for completion and validation

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 03: P2 Services (NEXT)
**Services**: gateway (6h), live-gateway (5h)  
**Time**: 11 hours  
**Dependencies**: Task 02 must pass validation  
**Priority**: Data ingestion services

**What to do**:
1. Wait for Task 02 validation to pass
2. Follow the same 10-step pattern as Task 02:
   - Copy source code from Trade2025
   - Create config files
   - Update URLs (localhost ‚Üí Docker names)
   - Build Docker images  
   - Test component
   - Test integration
   - Validate performance
   - Pass validation gate

**Key Differences from Task 02**:
- **Needs API keys**: Exchange API keys required (or paper trading)
- **External dependencies**: CCXT, exchange APIs
- **Security critical**: Secrets must be managed properly
- **Paper trading first**: ALWAYS test in paper mode first

**Critical Files to Create**:
```
config/backend/gateway/config.yaml
config/backend/live_gateway/config.yaml
secrets/gateway.env (API keys)
secrets/live_gateway.env (API keys)
```

**docker-compose.apps.yml**: Already has entries for both services ‚úÖ

**Validation Gate After Task 03**:
- [ ] Both services running and healthy
- [ ] Gateway fetching market data from exchanges
- [ ] Live-gateway can execute paper trading orders
- [ ] Market data flowing: Exchange ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí NATS ‚Üí Normalizer
- [ ] Order flow working: Order ‚Üí Live-gateway ‚Üí Paper execution ‚Üí Fill

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 04: P3 Services (CRITICAL)
**Services**: risk (6h), oms (8h)  
**Time**: 14 hours  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 02-03 must pass validation  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Core trading functionality

**What to do**:
1. Wait for Task 03 validation to pass
2. Follow same 10-step pattern
3. **EXTRA TESTING REQUIRED** - These are mission-critical services

**Why Critical**:
- **risk**: Pre-trade risk checks, must be < 1.5ms latency
- **oms**: Central hub for all trading, complex state management
- **High risk**: Trading disruption if these fail

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Risk service**: P50 latency ‚â§ 1.5ms (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **OMS**: P50 ‚â§ 10ms, P99 ‚â§ 50ms
- **Load testing**: Must sustain 1000 orders/sec

**CRITICAL VALIDATION GATE After Task 04**:
```
FULL TRADING FLOW TEST (MANDATORY):

1. Submit test order via OMS
2. Risk check (must be < 1.5ms)
3. Order routed to live-gateway  
4. Order status updates
5. Position tracking works
6. Fill processing works
7. Data persisted to QuestDB

LOAD TEST (MANDATORY):
- Sustain 1000 orders/sec for 5 minutes
- Risk: P50 < 1.5ms
- OMS: P50 < 10ms, P99 < 50ms
- No errors or crashes

ONLY PROCEED TO TASK 05 IF ALL PASS
```

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 05: P4 Services (SUPPORTING)
**Services**: ptrc (4h), feast-pipeline (2h), + 4 others (7h)  
**Time**: 13 hours  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 02-04 must pass validation  
**Priority**: Supporting services, non-critical

**What to do**:
1. Wait for Task 04 CRITICAL validation to pass
2. Follow same 10-step pattern
3. These are lower risk, can work faster

**Services**:
- ptrc: P&L, tax, risk reports, compliance
- feast-pipeline: Feature store materialization
- execution-quality: Execution monitoring
- compliance-scanner: Wash trading detection  
- logger: Centralized logging
- monitoring: System monitoring

**Less Critical**: These support operations but don't block core trading

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Task 06: P5 Services (OPTIONAL)
**Services**: serving, bt-orchestrator, ml-training, marketplace, modelops  
**Time**: 22 hours  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 02-05 complete  
**Status**: **OPTIONAL - Recommend skipping for MVP**

**Recommendation**: **SKIP** and do in Phase 4 (ML Library)

**Why Skip**:
- ML services not required for core trading
- Phase 4 will build unified ML Library anyway
- Saves 22 hours
- Focus on getting MVP operational first

**If you decide to do it**:
- Same 10-step pattern
- Low risk (optional services)
- Can execute if time permits

---

## üéØ NEXT PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE

### When Task 02 Complete

**Verify Task 02 first**:
```bash
# Check all P1 services healthy
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.apps.yml ps

# Should show:
# normalizer    running (healthy)
# sink-ticks    running (healthy)
# sink-alt      running (healthy)
```

**Then give Claude Code this prompt**:

```
Task 02 (P1 services) is complete and validated. 

Please proceed with Phase 2 Task 03: Migrate Priority 2 Services.

Services to migrate:
1. gateway (6 hours) - Market data ingestion from exchanges
2. live-gateway (5 hours) - Order execution on exchanges

Follow the same 10-step pattern as Task 02:
1. Copy source code from C:\Trade2025\trading\apps\{gateway|live_gateway}\
2. Create config files (config/backend/{service}/config.yaml)
3. Create secrets files (secrets/{service}.env) for exchange API keys
4. Update all URLs (localhost ‚Üí Docker service names)
5. Build Docker images
6. Component testing
7. Integration testing
8. Performance validation
9. Validation gate
10. Update tracker

CRITICAL: 
- Start with paper trading mode ONLY
- Never use real API keys until fully validated
- Gateway needs exchange API keys (or mock mode)
- Live-gateway MUST use paper trading initially

The docker-compose.apps.yml already has entries for both services.

Begin with gateway service.
```

---

### When Task 03 Complete

**Then give this prompt**:

```
Task 03 (P2 services) is complete and validated.

Please proceed with Phase 2 Task 04: Migrate Priority 3 Services (CRITICAL TASK).

Services to migrate:
1. risk (6 hours) - Pre-trade risk checks (LATENCY CRITICAL: < 1.5ms)
2. oms (8 hours) - Order Management System (CENTRAL HUB)

This is a CRITICAL task. These services are core trading functionality.

After both services are migrated and tested, you MUST run the CRITICAL VALIDATION GATE:

FULL TRADING FLOW TEST:
1. Submit test order via OMS API
2. Verify risk check completes in < 1.5ms
3. Verify order routed to live-gateway
4. Verify position tracking
5. Verify fill processing
6. Verify data persistence

LOAD TEST:
- 1000 orders/sec sustained for 5 minutes
- Risk service: P50 < 1.5ms (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- OMS: P50 < 10ms, P99 < 50ms

ONLY proceed to Task 05 if ALL validation passes.

Begin with risk service (it's required by OMS).
```

---

### When Task 04 Complete

**Then give this prompt**:

```
Task 04 (P3 services - CRITICAL) is complete and CRITICAL validation passed.

You can now choose:

OPTION A (RECOMMENDED): Proceed with Task 05 (P4 Supporting Services)
- 6 services: ptrc, feast-pipeline, execution-quality, compliance-scanner, logger, monitoring
- 13 hours total
- After this, Phase 2 MVP is complete (Tasks 01-05)

OPTION B: Skip to Phase 3 (Frontend Integration)
- Phase 2 MVP complete with P1-P4 services
- Can do Task 05 later if needed

OPTION C: Do Task 06 (P5 ML Services) - NOT RECOMMENDED
- 5 ML services, 22 hours
- Better to defer to Phase 4 (ML Library)

What would you like to do? (Recommend Option A)
```

## üìö UNIVERSAL PATTERN (ALL SERVICES)

### 10-Step Process

**Every service migration follows this pattern**:

```
1. COPY source from Trade2025
   ‚îî‚îÄ C:\Trade2025\trading\apps\{service}\ 
      ‚Üí C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026\backend\apps\{service}\

2. CREATE config file
   ‚îî‚îÄ config/backend/{service}/config.yaml
   ‚îî‚îÄ Use Docker service names (nats:4222, not localhost:4222)

3. UPDATE code
   ‚îî‚îÄ Replace all localhost with Docker service names
   ‚îî‚îÄ Update config paths to /app/config/config.yaml

4. BUILD Docker image
   ‚îî‚îÄ docker build -t localhost/{service}:latest .

5. ADD to docker-compose (ALREADY DONE ‚úÖ)
   ‚îî‚îÄ docker-compose.apps.yml has all services

6. TEST component (isolated)
   ‚îî‚îÄ docker-compose up -d {service}
   ‚îî‚îÄ docker logs {service}
   ‚îî‚îÄ Health check passes

7. TEST integration (with dependencies)
   ‚îî‚îÄ End-to-end data/order flow
   ‚îî‚îÄ NATS pub/sub working
   ‚îî‚îÄ Database writes persisting

8. VALIDATE performance
   ‚îî‚îÄ Latency benchmarks (P50, P99)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Throughput targets
   ‚îî‚îÄ Resource usage acceptable

9. VALIDATION GATE
   ‚îî‚îÄ All tests pass
   ‚îî‚îÄ Performance met
   ‚îî‚îÄ Ready for next service/task

10. UPDATE tracker
    ‚îî‚îÄ COMPLETION_TRACKER.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ Mark service/task complete
```

---

## üîí CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Never Use Localhost ‚ùå

```yaml
# WRONG - Will not work in Docker
nats_url: "nats://localhost:4222"
valkey_url: "redis://localhost:6379"

# CORRECT - Docker service names
nats_url: "nats://nats:4222"
valkey_url: "redis://valkey:6379"
```

### Always Validate Before Proceeding ‚úÖ

- Each task has a validation gate
- Must pass before next task
- Task 04 has CRITICAL gate (trading flow)
- Never skip validation

### Paper Trading First üìã

- live-gateway MUST start in paper mode
- Test thoroughly before real money
- Validate order flow completely
- Only switch to live after full validation

### Risk Service Latency ‚ö°

- P50 ‚â§ 1.5ms (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- This is a hard requirement
- Load test at 10k checks/sec
- Monitor continuously
