## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

### Option 1: Manual Cleanup (Recommended)
```powershell
cd C:\ClaudeDesktop_Projects\Trade2026

# Delete obsolete files
del 00_MASTER_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
del README_START_HERE.md
del README.md
del README_CLEAN.md
del FILE_ORGANIZATION.md

- Read `MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Use `instructions/` folder
